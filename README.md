# N-Yost.github.io

This is the repo for my internet resume. I considered using React and Tailwindcss, but decided to keep it
simple by using pure HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for positioning and reponsive design since I'm most familiar
with it. It is deployed from the main branch using the basic deployment that Github offers with their
Pages framework.
